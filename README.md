# Chip Debugger

This is an application made on a whim to debug a faulty adder circuit that ended
up working without needing this application. It is a relatively simple program. 
All you need is a config file like the example provided for the 74HC283 chip, 
where you provide the name, pins, and a truth table in CSV format. You can then 
load that config into the program and use it to display and test various inputs 
and outputs.

Note that this was created over the span of 4 hours while I should have been 
paying attention in class. It is likely not very good, stable, or useful. 
However, on the off-chance that some poor sod has to try and deal with an 
uncooperative circuit for their own electrical/computer engineering course, then
maybe this can help them a little bit.
